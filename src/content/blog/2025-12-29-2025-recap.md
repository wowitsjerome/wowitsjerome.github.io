## See ya 2025, come on in 2026!

It's that time of the year again where we get a little reflective and look back at all the things in the past year. Either to commiserate with others or to at least make sure we don't repeat the same mistakes we've made this year. However, in documenting it, I think we only prove to others that we're stubborn and don't easily learn lessons. However, here's to hoping we grow even a little wiser this year and are able to carry it over to the next.

## Here's what I learned
- This is the year I finally felt like an adult. Do I know what I'm doing yet? Not really, but for the first time I've felt the realization that I indeed am an adult (although at times I do not act like it).
- Community is important and there's little room for friendships that are not aligned with my own personal values.
- AI is a force multiplier and will continue to change how I work as an engineer and engineering leader.
- Audiobooks are a great way to help me fall asleep.
