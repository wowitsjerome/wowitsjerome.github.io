			<h1>Reflections on AI</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to my blog where I share professional and personal reflections on artificial intelligence,
				its impact on society, technology, and our daily lives.
			</p>
			<p>
				This space is for exploring ideas, documenting learnings, and engaging in thoughtful discourse
				about the rapidly evolving field of AI. From technical deep-dives to philosophical musings,
				I'll be sharing perspectives on what it means to work with and live alongside AI.
