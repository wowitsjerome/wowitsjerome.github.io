	<p>
		I'm Jerome Placido, and this blog is where I share my professional and personal reflections on artificial intelligence.
	</p>

	<p>
		My interest in AI spans both the technical and philosophical dimensions of the field. I believe
		that understanding AI requires not just technical knowledge, but also thoughtful consideration of
		its implications for society, ethics, and our daily lives.
	</p>

	<p>
		Through this blog, I aim to document my journey of learning, share insights from my work with AI
		systems, and contribute to the broader conversation about how AI is reshaping our world.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you'd like to connect or discuss any of the topics I write about, feel free to reach out. I'm
		always interested in engaging with others who are thinking deeply about AI and its future.
